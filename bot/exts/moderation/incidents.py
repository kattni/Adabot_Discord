        Pre-process `payload` and pass it to `process_event` if appropriate.

        We abort instantly if `payload` doesn't relate to a message sent in #incidents,
        or if it was sent by a bot.

        If `payload` relates to a message in #incidents, we first ensure that `crawl_task` has
        finished, to make sure we don't mutate channel state as we're crawling it.

        Next, we acquire `event_lock` - to prevent racing, events are processed one at a time.

        Once we have the lock, the `disnake.Message` object for this event must be resolved.
        If the lock was previously held by an event which successfully relayed the incident,
        this will fail and we abort the current event.

        Finally, with both the lock and the `disnake.Message` instance in our hands, we delegate
        to `process_event` to handle the event.

        The justification for using a raw listener is the need to receive events for messages
        which were not cached in the current session. As a result, a certain amount of
        complexity is introduced, but at the moment this doesn't appear to be avoidable.
