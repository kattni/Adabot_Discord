Welcome to Python Discord!

To show you what kind of community we are, we've created this video:
https://youtu.be/ZH26PuX3re0

As a new user, you have read-only access to a few select channels to give you a taste of what our server is like. \
In order to see the rest of the channels and to send messages, you first have to accept our rules.
"""

VERIFIED_MESSAGE = f"""
You are now verified!

You can find a copy of our rules for reference at <https://pythondiscord.com/pages/rules>.

Additionally, if you'd like to receive notifications for the announcements \
we post in <#{constants.Channels.announcements}>
from time to time, you can send `{constants.Bot.prefix}subscribe` to <#{constants.Channels.bot_commands}> at any time \
to assign yourself the **Announcements** role. We'll mention this role every time we make an announcement.

If you'd like to unsubscribe from the announcement notifications, simply send `{constants.Bot.prefix}subscribe` to \
<#{constants.Channels.bot_commands}> and click the role again!.

To introduce you to our community, we've made the following video:
